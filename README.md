# 🚗 Car Price Predictor - Internship Task 2 (InternPe)

A machine learning project that predicts the price of a used car based on its brand, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and other features.  
This project was completed as **Task 2** during my internship at **InternPe**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess real-world car listings data.
- Build a regression model using **Linear Regression** to predict used car prices.
- Create an interactive user interface with **Streamlit** for predictions.
- Deploy and share the project for public use.
