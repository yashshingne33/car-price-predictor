# 🚗 Car Price Predictor - Internship Task 2 (InternPe)

A machine learning project that predicts the price of a used car based on its brand, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and other features.  
This project was completed as **Task 2** during my internship at **InternPe**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess real-world car listings data.
- Build a regression model using **Linear Regression** to predict used car prices.
- Create an interactive user interface with **Streamlit** for predictions.
- Deploy and share the project for public use.

## 💡 Features

- 📊 Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling strings, NaNs, outliers)
- 📈 Linear Regression Model training & evaluation
- 🧠 Car price prediction based on user inputs
- 💻 Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit web app
- ✅ Clean UI and error-handled backend logic

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pickle, streamlit  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub
